# Hey there!
<p>This is Scripto, your console-only assistant to help you setup your React projects.</p>
<p>
    I have been designed and developed from :heart: and with :coffee: by a lazy developer at 4 in the morning!
</p>

<h2>What are my super powers?</h2>
<p>
    That's an interesting question! Well I am not as intelligent as Jarvis or as sassy as Ultron, but I still might be able to help you. You can download me in your machine (I swear I won't look at your browsing history!) and either tell me where you keep your boilerplates or just use the boilerplates my dev uses. Also I would need to know where you store your projects!
</p>

<p>
    I have a 4 step process. Anytime you want to start a new project, you can spin me up.
    <ol>
        <li>I will ask you for the config you want and the folder that you want to create</li>
        <li>I will create this new folder and clone that branch into this.</li>
        <li>I will use Yarn to install its dependencies and then to upgrade them to the most recent major version (^).</li>
        <li>I will then open VS Code into for that folder.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
    And just like that, you are up and running! By default, I use Yarn and VS Code, but my future upgrades might allow me to use NPM and other editors as well!
</p>

<h2>How to tune me for your first use?</h2>
<p>You can ammend the following variables as per your usage.</p>
| Name          | Purpose                                                               | Type   |
| ------------- |:---------------------------------------------------------------------:| ------:|
| BASE_DIR      | the directory where you will store the project.                       | String |
| REPO_URL      | URL of your boilerplate repository.                                   | String |
| BRANCH        | Branch name in the repos. You can modify them for your custom config. | String |

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>I am just trying to help you! I do what you say.</p>

# Thanks!
<p>
    Thanks for allowing me to be a good butler. Please provide me with some feedback so that I can help my dev lear and grow and be a better dev! :blush:
